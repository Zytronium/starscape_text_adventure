### Combat Updates
- Add chance to encounter smaller groups of enemy NPC ships instead of larger fleets
  - 1-2 weak drones in secure
  - 2-4 weak drones or 1-3 weak pirates in unsecure and contested (less weak than in secure, but still weak)
  - 4-6 drones or 3-5 pirates in wild
- Replace larger fleets/groups with wave-based groups
  - **Fireteams**: 2 waves + squad leader on wave 2
    - Only found in secure systems.
  - **Squadrons**: 3 waves + squad leader on wave 3
    - Found in secure, contested, and unsecure systems.
  - **Dens/Factories**: Infinite waves until the pirate den or drone factory structure is destroyed.
    - No command ship
    - Found in all systems except core, but more difficult in less secure space.
  - **Fleets**: 4 waves + squad lieutenant or commander on wave 4
    - Found in contested, unsecure, and wild systems
  - **Armadas**: 5 waves + commander or captain on wave 5
    - Only found in wild systems.
    - If this was a drone armada, there's a 10% chance upon defeating the command ship for a drone battleship to warp in.
      - Drone battleships are treated as large structures with infinite waves of enemy ships guarding them.
      - Drone battleships are the only structure capable of fighting back, and are extremely powerful.
      - Drone battleships will have unique combat tactics available, including falling back to a safer distance to let shields recharge.
  - Each wave has more ships than the last wave.
  - Not all ships in the group will fire on the player every turn
  - Firing weapons at all ships at once should no longer fire on all ships, but instead limit to at most 4 ships per turn.
