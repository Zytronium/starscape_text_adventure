# Starscape: Text Adventure Edition

## Lore
Starscape is a dying game. Starscape Text Adventure Edition takes place 
after everyone has stopped playing the game and it is dead for good. You,
the last player, find this hidden gem and play it alone like a singleplayer
game.

Players are a long forgotten type of person who has a special property:
They are sentient. Unlike the other NPCs in this galaxy, players have
free will and live on a whole 'nother plane of existence - literally.
They live in the real world, controlling their character in this universe.
All players of the past have lost interest in this universe and have
slowly disappeared over time. However, you, the last Starscape player,
 believe it is worth a play anyway, even if it is now basically a 
singleplayer game. 

Traditionally, CoreSec would clone new players into existence. How this was
done is not known, but this practice was used less and less often as time
went on until Core Sec has decided to shut down the program entirely after you
first clone in. There will be no more players after you. 

While the cloning bay is still open for cloning you in after you die, it is
best not to die, as it is rather unpleasant, and you will lose your ship and
inventory. CoreSec cannot recover this for you. They discontinued insurance 
due to so few people using it, as real players were the only people who were
eligible for insurance.

## Game Mechanics

### Star Systems
Star systems function as different zones you can travel to. You travel between
systems by warping in your spaceship. Most star systems in Core, Secure,
Contested, and Unsecure space have space stations. Wild systems have no space
stations.

There are several types of space stations, each with their own different types
of station modules you can visit, i.e., manufacturing, general marketplace, 
refinery, etc. While docked at a space station, you can visit each of these
facilities and interact with them. If the station has a repair bay, you can
also repair your ship's hull while docked. 

Each star system is likely to have anomalies. You can scan for anomalies using
system probes, which can be bought or manufactured for cheap. At each anomaly,
you can find rare ores to mine, encounter hostile forces, loot wreckage fields
from a previous battle, or purchase spice from special spice platforms. 

Data on each star system, from the connected systems to the color of spice, are
taken from real in-game data scrapped by [Starscape Datamine](https://github.com/EnderBoy9217/Starscape-Datamine)
on GitHub.

### Marketplace
Unlike in Starscape, the general marketplace will be global across all star
systems. Simialr to Starscape, the player marketplace is disabled (as you're the
only player), so your buy and sell prices may not be as good as you would 
typically find during Starscape's prime. To account for this, prices will be
slightly better than what they actually are in-game.

You will be able to sell just about any item and buy a large variety of items
from the global NPC marketplace. There are several types of marketplaces:
- General Marketplace
  - This marketplace buys and sells almost any item except ships
- Ship Vendor
  - This marketplace buys and sells low-tier ships
- I can't think of anything else that makes sense for this version of the game
  - The original Starscape also had clothing shops and weapons dealers, but they
    are not applicable to a game with no ground combat.
